### Data Source
The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "HR-Employee-Attrition.csv", which was provided by MeriSkill for my Intership program.
### Tools Used
- Excel (For Data Cleaning)
- PowerBI (EDA and Visualization Report)
### Data Cleaning/Preparation
Activities carried out to make sure the data is fit for analyses;
- Load and inspect the data to check for integrity and identify impurities
- Handling missing and outlier values
- Reformatting - Correcting data format and accurate data types
###  Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA and exploring the HR dataset to answer the main question such as;
- What is the Percentage attrition rate?
- Is distance a factor for attrition?
- What is the average monthly income and how it affect the attrition rate?
- What is the correlation between overtime and People that left?
- Which Department/Job role has the highest number of employee that left?
- How does Marital Status affect the employee?
### Data Analysis Result
The analysis results are summarized as follows;
-  Laboratory technician lost most workers (62) followed by Sales executive (57) and Research scientist (47).
-  31% of overtime workers left and a few (10%) of non-overtime worker.
-  Attrition rate was high among employee that just joined the company and those who rarely travel.
-  Surprisingly, people whose reside close to has the highest attrition rate when it comes to distance. which show that distance is not a deciding factor.
  
### Recommendations
I'll recommend that;
- There should be focus on entry level employee and those few years joining the company to find out why most of them leave.
- There should be sensitization and training for newbie to boost their morale and also equip them with the pros and cons of the company.
- Work pay rates should be check and modify reasonably to commensurate with work as this is evident with more people opting for overtime.
- Business travels should be done in such a way that newbies (and those who rarely travel) can also be a tag-along to expose them to business outside the four walls of the office.
